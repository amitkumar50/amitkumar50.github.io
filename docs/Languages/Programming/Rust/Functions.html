  <h3 id="closuret">Closure Types</h3>
  <h4>Move Closure</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A move closure captures variables from its environment by taking ownership of them (i.e., moving them).</li>
    </ul>
    Example
    <pre><code>
        fn main() {
            let x = 10;
            let closure = || {
                println!("Value of x: {}", x);
            };
            closure(); // This is a move closure since it captures 'x' by moving it.
            // 'x' cannot be used after this point, as it has been moved into the closure.
        }        
    </code></pre>

  <h4>Borrow Closure</h4>
    <ul><li>
        A borrow closure captures variables by borrowing them (i.e., creating references to them).
    </li></ul>
