        <h3 id="capportal">Captive Portal</h3>
            <p>A captive portal is a web page that users must interact with before accessing a public network. 
                It's often used by public venues that offer free Wi-Fi, such as airports, hotels, and coffee shops</p>

        <h3 id="sase">SASE(Secure Access Service Edge)</h3>
        <p>
            <b>What?</b> Architectural approach for providing network security at wide-area networking (WAN) delivered as a cloud service
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Usage?</b> 
            Secure access to applications and data for users regardless of their location or the underlying network infrastructure
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example</b><br>
            - Consider a multinational corporation(HCL Tech) with branch offices across different regions. India(Delhi, Mumbai), US(NY, chicago)<br>
            - Each office requires secure access to the corporate network and cloud-based applications.<br>
            - With SASE, security and all services delivered from cloud, allowing employees to securely connect to the corporate network and cloud applications from any location using a unified and consistent security policy
        </p>
        <pre>
            HCL Offices
            (Delhi)India        (Mumbai)India       (NY)US      (Chicago)US     
                   \                |                   |             /
                    \               |                   |            /
                     ---------------SASE(Service from Cloud)--------
                                            |
                                     AWS Cloud (App, Data)
        </pre>

        <h3 id="sdwan">SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network)</h3>
        <p><b>What?</b><br>
            - Enables organizations to build higher-performance WANs using lower-cost and commercially available internet access<br>
            - Separates of networking hardware and control mechanisms
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example</b><br>
            - Consider a retail chain(Relaince) with numerous stores across the country
            - Each store requires reliable connectivity to Central DB to POS devices.
            - 1 solution is to use MPLS circuits for connectivity between stores and headquarters, other is SD-WAN.
            - With SD-WAN retail chain achieves cost savings, improved application performance
        </p>

        <h3 id="sse">SSE (Secure Service Edge)</h3>
        <p><b>What?</b> 
            Integration of security services directly into the network edge
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example</b><br>
            - Consider a healthcare organization(Apollo) that needs to provide secure access to electronic health records (EHR).<br>
            - Organization implements secure web gateways (SWG), next-generation firewalls (NGFW), intrusion prevention systems(IPS) into the network edge.<br>
            - Allows organization to enforce consistent security policies, inspect and filter internet traffic, and detect and mitigate threats in real-time
        </p>
