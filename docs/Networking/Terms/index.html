        <h3 id="capportal">Captive Portal</h3>
            <p>A captive portal is a web page that users must interact with before accessing a public network. 
                It's often used by public venues that offer free Wi-Fi, such as airports, hotels, and coffee shops</p>

        <h3 id="whycloud">Why Cloud?</h3>
        <dt>
            - Cloud adoption is all time high and constantly growing. 
            The demand for remote workforce is increasing and per Gartner research demand for remote working is set to increase 30% by 2030, 
            post coronavirus pandemic which has forced world wide organizations to adopt a hybrid working model.<br>
            - All application(FaaS, SaaS, Sharepoint, office365) as moving to cloud and organizations want secure, seemless access by all employees(in office, home, branch offices)
            to these applications

        <h3 id="gartner">Gartner Given Terms</h3>
        <h4 id="magicquadrant">Gartner Magic Quadrant</h4>
        <dl>
            The Gartner Magic Quadrant is a research report that helps identify and assess the top 10-12 players in a specific global market<br>
            It provides a visual representation of different types of technology providers and their position in fast-growing markets.
        </dl>

        <h4 id="sase">SASE(Secure Access Service Edge)</h4>
        <dl><strong>What is SASE?</strong></dl>
        <p>
            - Gartner gave SASE term in year 2019 to define networking and security capabilities into a single service sitting on cloud.<br>
            - Providing network security at wide-area networking (WAN) delivered as a cloud service.<br>
            - All users in branch office, home, roaming(airport) if he want to access any of cloud service()
            he will go thru SASE.<br>
            - Examples: 
            <a href="https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/security/secure-edge.html">Juniper Secure Edge</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/capabilities/secure-access-service-edge">ZScaler Zero Trust SASE</a>,

        </p>

        <dl><strong>Example</strong></dl>
        <p>
        - Consider a multinational corporation(HCL Tech) with branch offices across different regions.<br>
        - Each office requires secure access to the corporate network and cloud-based applications.<br>
        - With SASE, security and all services delivered from cloud, allowing employees to securely connect to the corporate network and cloud applications from any location using a unified and consistent security policy

        <p><b>What?</b><br>
            - Helps organizations to connect branch offices, central office(HQ), Services on cloud in fast, cost effective way<br>
            - Uses <a href="#sdn">SDN(software defined network)</a> to separate hardware and control mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example</b><br> 
            - Consider a retail chain(Relaince) with numerous branch offices across the country. <br>
            - Each branch office(store) requires reliable connectivity to Central or HQ services(eg: DB) to POS devices.<br>
            - 1 solution is to use <a href="/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-2.5/mpls.html">MPLS</a> for connectivity 
            between stores and headquarters(But this is expensive), other is SD-WAN.<br>
            - With SD-WAN retail chain achieves cost savings, improved application performance

            - Organization implements secure web gateways (SWG), next-generation firewalls (NGFW), intrusion prevention systems(IPS) into the network edge.<br>
            - Allows organization to enforce consistent security policies, inspect and filter internet traffic, and detect and mitigate threats in real-time

        <dt>This is a Solution that helps organizations recognize and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities.<br>
            It can detect user behavior anomalies(Eg: from Active Directory event logs).<br>
            (Early Days) SIEM platforms were log management tools, They enabled real-time monitoring and analysis of security-related events.<br>
            (Present Day) SIEM software has evolved to incorporate user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) & other advanced AI methods
            to identify anomalous behaviors and indicators of advanced threats.

        <br>
        <dl><strong>Incident monitoring and security alerts</strong></dl>
