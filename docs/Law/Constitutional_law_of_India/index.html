        </dl>

        <dl><strong>Why preamble is needed?</strong></dl>
        <dt>
            Preamble tells about:<br>
            - Why we need constitution<br>
            - Principles(values, morals, principles, and objectives) of constitution<br>
            - How ideal constitution should be<br>
            - guide book for constitution<br>
            - Constitution's adoption date: Preamble has Constitution's adoption date, November 26, 1949.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dl><strong>Preamble is part of the Constitution</strong></dl>
        <dt>
            1960,Berubari Case the Supreme Court declared that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution.<br>
            <a href="#directiveprinciples">1973, Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerela Case</a>, it held that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dl><strong>Amendable</strong></dl> 
        <dt>
            Basic structure of the Preamble cannot be amended. <br>
            The Preamble has been amended once, through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. where "Socialist", "Secular" words added to Preamble.<br>
        </dt>

        <h3 id="principles">Principles of Constitution</h3>
        <dl><strong>Directive Principles</strong> These principles set out the 
            fundamental principles of economic justice. They mandate that the state should
             promote equality of opportunity and prohibit the concentration of wealth.</dl>
        <dl><strong>Fundamental rights</strong> These rights promote the idea of political democracy and 
            limit the tyranny of the executive 
            and arbitrary laws of the legislature. There are six fundamental rights</dl>
            
        <dl><strong>Independent judiciary</strong> This is the third organ of government 
            that conducts all the legal work. It is independent and unbiased.</dl>

        <h4 id="republic">Republic</h4>
        <dt>People elect their representatives and elected representatives hold the supreme power</dt>

        <h4 id="secular">Secular</h4>
        <dt>The government respects all religions and does not uplift or degrade any particular religion</dt>
            
        <h4 id="socialist">Socialist</h4>
        <dt>
            - Set of beliefs that all people are equal and should share equally in a country's money<br>
            - Socialist is opposite of Captalist
        </dt>

        <h4 id="sovereign">Sovereign</h4>
        <dt>India is not subject to any foreign power and the state is free to 
            legislate on any subject in conformity with the constitution. </dt>
            
        <dl><strong>Equality</strong>
        This is considered to be the essence of modern democratic ideology</dl>
            
        <dl><strong>Parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy</strong> The Indian Constitution has a 
            proper balance between these two principles. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review 
            and can cancel any Parliamentary law as unconstitutional.</dl>
        
        <dl><strong>Doctrine of Separation of powers(Sem-2)</strong></dl>
        <dt>
            All 3 should have seperate powers: <br>
            - Executive(Enforces laws): Government<br>
            - Legislative(makes laws): Parliament<br>
            - Judicial(administers justice): Courts<br><br>

            This doctrine is well written in Constitution of US, but not in Indian constitution<br>
            Only President vests executive powers(written in Art 53), but none other is mentioned anywhere<br>
            But duties of all 3 bodies seperately are well written in Indian constitution.

        <dl id="quasifederal"><strong>Quasi Federal</strong></dl> 
            <dd>
                - A system where the central government has more power than the states<br>
                - India is considered a quasi-federal state because it has features of both a federal and a unitary system.
                - India has a strong central government, which is why it is considered quasi-federal. 
                - The Supreme Court of India has also described the Indian Constitution as quasi-federal.
            </dd>

            <dt><u>Characteristics of Quasi federal</u></dt>
            <dd>
                - Clear divisions of powers b/w central and states: The state has power over local matters and the 
                center has power over national matters.<br>
                - Judicial independence: An independent judicial body decides the rights of the units 
                and keeps them within their limits.<br>
                - Single citizenship: Citizens can only have 1 citizenship. This helps to increase a 
                sense of nationality and unity.<br>
                - Bicameral legislature: The legislature has two houses, chambers, or factions. 
                The lower house usually represents the interests of the nation.<br>
                - Supremacy of constitution: A federal state derives its existence from the constitution.
            </dd>

        <h4 id="union">Union</h4>
        <dd>
            - The Union government has overriding powers in the subjects listed under the Concurrent List. <br>
            - The Union government cannot overrule the constitutional rights/powers of a state government 
            except when presidential rule is declared in a State<br>
            - India is a federal union of <u>28 states and 8 union territories</u>. 
            The states and union territories are further divided into districts and smaller administrative divisions. 
            Each state has a state government.

        <dl><strong>Characteristics/Features of fundamental rights</strong></dl>
