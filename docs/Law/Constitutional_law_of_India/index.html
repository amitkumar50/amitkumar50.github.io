        <h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
        <dl><strong>Preamble</strong>
            We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to 
            constitute India into a <a href="#sovereign">Sovereign</a>, <a href="#socialist">Socialist</a>,
            <a href="#secular">Secular</a>, <a href="#republic">Republic</a>
        </dl>
        <dl><strong>Preamble is part of the Constitution</strong> 
            The Supreme Court of India ruled in the 1973 case Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala</dl>
        <dl><strong>Amendable</strong> Basic structure of the Preamble cannot be amended. 
            The Preamble has been amended once, through the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. 
            This amendment added the words "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble.
            The Preamble is considered the "heart and soul" of the Constitution. 
            It outlines the ideals that should guide Indian democracy</dl>

        <h3 id="principles">Principles of Constitution</h3>
        <dl><strong>Directive Principles</strong> These principles set out the 
            fundamental principles of economic justice. They mandate that the state should
             promote equality of opportunity and prohibit the concentration of wealth.</dl>
        <dl><strong>Fundamental rights</strong> These rights promote the idea of political democracy and 
            limit the tyranny of the executive 
            and arbitrary laws of the legislature. There are six fundamental rights</dl>
            
        <dl><strong>Independent judiciary</strong> This is the third organ of government 
            that conducts all the legal work. It is independent and unbiased.</dl>

        <h4 id="#republic">Republic</h4>
        <dl>Form of government in which the people or their elected representatives hold the supreme power</dl>

        <h4 id="#secular">Secular</h4>
        <dl>The government respects all religions and does not uplift or degrade any particular religion</dl>
            
        <h4 id="#socialist">Socialist</h4>
        <dl>public ownership of property and natural resources. It's based on the idea that public ownership of 
            resources and means of production leads to a more equal society</dl>
        <h4 id="#sovereign">Sovereign</h4>
        <dl>India is not subject to any foreign power and the state is free to 
            legislate on any subject in conformity with the constitution. </dl>
            
        <dl><strong>Equality</strong> This is considered to be the essence of modern democratic ideology</dl>
            
        <dl><strong>Parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy</strong> The Indian Constitution has a 
            proper balance between these two principles. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review 
            and can cancel any Parliamentary law as unconstitutional.</dl>

        <h4 id="quasifederal">Quasi Federal</h4>
            <dd>A system where the central government has more power than the states</dd>
            <dd>India is considered a quasi-federal state because it has features of both a federal and a unitary system.
                India has a strong central government, which is why it is considered quasi-federal. 
                The Supreme Court of India has also described the Indian Constitution as quasi-federal.
            </dd>
            <dl>Characteristics of Quasi federal</dl>
            <dd>Separation of powers: The state and central government have clear divisions of powers. 
                The state has power over local matters and the center has power over national matters.
            <dd>Judicial independence: An independent judicial body decides the rights of the units 
                and keeps them within their limits.</dd>
            <dd>Single citizenship: Citizens can only have one citizenship. This helps to increase a 
                sense of nationality and unity.</dd>
            <dd>Bicameral legislature: The legislature has two houses, chambers, or factions. 
                The lower house usually represents the interests of the nation.</dd>
            <dd>Supremacy of constitution: A federal state derives its existence from the constitution.</dd>

        <h4 id="union">Union</h4>
        <dl>The Union government has overriding powers in the subjects listed under the Concurrent List. 
            The Union government cannot overrule the constitutional rights/powers of a state government 
            except when presidential rule is declared in a State</dl>
        <dl>India is a federal union of 28 states and 8 union territories. The states and union territories are further divided into districts and smaller administrative divisions. Each state has a state government. 
        </dl>
        <dl><strong>Advantages of a Union over a Federation</strong></dl>
        <dd>Raising revenue: Unions can raise a larger share of the revenue</dd>
        <dd>Long-term projects: Unions can take on long-term infrastructure and governance projects.</dd>

        <dl><strong>India is called a Union of States not Federation of states</strong></dl>
        <dd>States were not formed by an agreement, States cannot leave the union,
            The Indian Constitution gives more power to the central government</dd>

        <h3 id="fundamentalrights">Fundamental Rights</h3>
        <dd>
            In India, any person who is a citizen of India can claim fundamental rights<br>
            Fundamental rights are available against the state
        </dd>

        <dl><strong>Characteristics/Features of fundamental rights</strong></dl>
        
        <dd>Qualified: They are not absolute. This means although the Constitution guarantees 
            certain fundamental rights and liberty to citizens, these rights are not unrestricted or absolute<br>
            Justiciable: If they are infringed(violated), an individual can go to court to have them enforced.<br>
            Not sacred or indestructible: They are not Sacred, permanent, or absolute.<br>
            Integral part of the Constitution: They are protected by the Constitution.<br>
            Right to equality: This is one of the chief guarantees of the Constitution.<br>
            Cultural and educational rights: These are for the conservation of the cultural practices of the 
            citizens and the right to education.<br>
            Right against exploitation: This includes the prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labor.</dd>

            <dd>Any law that is inconsistent with the fundamental 
                rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution is ineffective.<br>
                The law is not invalid, but is overshadowed by the fundamental right. 
                The inconsistency can be removed by a constitutional amendment.<br>
                However, in India, it has been largely overlooked by legal theorists and practitioners.
            </dd>

            <dl><strong><u>Doctrine of Severability</u></strong></dl>
            <dd>if a law violates fundamental rights, but is separable 
                from the rest of the law, then only that portion will be declared unconstitutional<br>
                The Doctrine of Severability has been adopted by many countries, including: 
                United Kingdom, Australia, United States of America, Malaysia, India<br>
                <u>The Doctrine of Severability was discussed in detail in the following cases:</u>
                    Vs Corp. Commissioner of Oklahoma,
                    Ayotte Vs Planned Parenthood of N. New England
            </dd>

        <h4 id="art14-18">1. Right to Equality(Art 14-18):</h4>
            <dl>14. Equality before law</dl>
                <dd>The concept of equality means that no one should have special privileges based 
                    on birth, creed, or other factors. 
                    The fundamentals of equality before law come from the Magna Carta, a pact 
                    signed in the UK to prohibit the monopolistic power of states.</dd>
            <dl><u>Rule of Law</u></dl>
                <dd>All laws apply equally to all citizens.<br>
                    No one is above the law, including government officials, wealthy people, 
                    and even the President. It also means that everyone is subject to the 
                    jurisdiction of ordinary courts of law, regardless of their position or status.<br>
                    every citizen has a right to approach the courts in case laws are violated<br>
                    The term "rule of law" originated in England and was adopted by India.<br>

            <dd>Article 22(1) of the Constitution guarantees the right to legal counsel.<br>
                Preventive detention can be used indefinitely, even in times of peace or non-emergency situations.<br>
                The District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police can make the order.<br>
